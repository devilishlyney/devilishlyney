## <p align="center">👋 Glad to make your acquaintance</p>

Welcome to my GitHub profile - I'm _**Emery** (he/him)_, a beginner dev from France. 🇫🇷 <br>
I'm 20 years old, and I'm a first-year **Computer Science** student. <br>
From 2023 to 2025, I studied English and Didactics of French as a foreign language.

## <p align="center">❤️ What I love</p>

**Music**, specifically metal and its many subgenres... Matter of fact, I own a beautiful black Eko SG electric guitar! <br>
**Drawing** - I've been drawing since I first picked up a pencil! It's a hobby I practice constantly through the years, both traditionally and digitally. (And it helps when I need to make assets for projects!)<br>
**Language learning**! Born to a French father and a Hungarian mother, I have discovered the beauty of speaking multiple languages very early in my life, as my mother spoke to me in Hungarian when I was a baby. Now, it's as a hobby that I learn languages. I'm a native speaker of French, speak English fluently, and have an intermediate level in German, Hungarian and Spanish. I am currently learning Finnish!
